# Go

In the python files finalLong and finalShort are two bots for playing gomoku that both use simlar but different statagies
(with the long taking more time to make moves than the short). These bots are made for a 8x8 game of gomoku rather than
the usual 19x19 so takes advantage of the lesser size and uses some techniques to make use of this. These are the product
of a lot of different ideas being pitted against eachother to decide what the best bot would be.
